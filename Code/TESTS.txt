char_set_teacher_tests:
- Check if the char_set_teacher_tests generates the correct characteristic set
- Since characteristic sets can be different, only small DFAs are tested

cteacher_learner_test:
- test one and two are DFA from the papers, using them as a standard
- there are some tests on edge cases such as one node
- Then there are some tests cases on large DFAs
